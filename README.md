### Typescript Practice Project
This is simple project for practicing your Typescipt skills.

------------


Type following commands in your terminal after downloading the project.

#### Step 01:
    npm install
The above command will download all the required dependencies in the project from npm.

#### Step 02 (optional):
Incase you do not have Typescript installed on your pc. Try this command to download and install Typescript globally.

    npm install -g typescript

#### Step 03:
    npx tsc
This command is for compiling your latest Typescript code in the 'dist' directory. You only need to run this command one time and then it watches any changes in the folders or files, and recompiles the Typescript automatically.


#### Step 04:
    npm run start

Finally this command will run the compiled JavaScript code from the 'dist' directory.
